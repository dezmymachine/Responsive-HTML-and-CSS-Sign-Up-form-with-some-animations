# Responsive-HTML-and-CSS-Sign-Up-form-with-some-animations
Basic HTML and CSS code for a responsive sign up page with some pseudo-class and pseudo-element selectors
Points to note:
1.The meta tag for "viewport" was added to make the site very responsive across multiple devices. This tag tells the browser to adjust the page's width to match the device's screen width
2.The media query added in the CSS applies different styles or layouts depending on the screen size
#Massive shoutouts to all the Youtube and frontend guys who guided this simple sign up 
Future repo with javascript and validation will be added later
